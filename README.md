DefEqn: this file defines the equations that were defined in the paper of the name in the title

DefEqn: this file defines the parameters and defines the Runge-Kutta update method

Process: this impliments the Runge-Kutta method. This also saves the files as .csv files os if running on another computer please change the address so that they are saved to 
your computer

Simulation: this allows for parameters - not defined in the paper - to be defined. As well as the time-step and number of iterations for the Runge-Kutta method.

Analysis: this plots the data obtained by the simulation
